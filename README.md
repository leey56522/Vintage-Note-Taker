This is a note taking app where the written note will be stored in local storage.
Marked library(https://marked.js.org/) was used to enable markdown feature for note writing.
The user can delete note or toggle between view only mode and writing mode. 

## Challenges I encountered
1. Implementing Marked library and parsing text
2. Figuring out the way to toggle between writing mode and view only mode
3. Storing note content into local storage and loading stored note whenever the page loads


## Things I leanred
1. Using Marked library and markdown syntax
2. local storage implementation
